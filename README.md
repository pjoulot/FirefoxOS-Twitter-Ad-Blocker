An addon to remove ads on the Twitter apps and the Twitter website for Firefox OS devices.

This addon doesn't work anymore since Twitter changed his website. I need to work on that.

##Informations

The addon basically juste remove the tweets that have been chosen by Twitter as ads. It lets only tweets from people that you follow in your timeline.

##Problems
Please report me all problems you can encounter creating an issue. Give me more details as possible and I will try to fix it.
If the addon is updated, you will maybe need to reboot your phone to apply the changes.
